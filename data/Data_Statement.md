More finalized data is stored within this folder on GitHub. Initial remote sensing data can be extremely large, far too much for GitHub. Two resources were used for the initial data here: the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 dataset (HLS). 

1. NLCD
The NLCD is developed by the USGS. It categorizes all land in the United States into one of a small number of land cover classes at a 30-meter resolution. As of recent updates, it covers every year from 1985 to 2023. You can learn more about the NLCD [here](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/annual-national-land-cover-database).

2. HLS
HLS is a combination of data from two similar satellite systems, NASA's Landsat program and the EU's Sentinel-2 program. The HLS dataset combines the data from these satellites into a common framework (projection, tiling system, resolution etc.) so that they can be used together.
