<h3> HLS Processing </h3>
This folder is for scripts used to process the raw HLS data into something more useable in machine learning. Right now, I have it very barebones. Usually these data are processed into indices etc. for use in real remote sensing projects. I guess that's "feature engineering"

Currently there is a step (mosaicking the datasets) which is skipped in this folder. It will be done later.
